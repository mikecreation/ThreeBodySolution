# ThreeBodySolution

Most people try to solve the Three-Body Problem by simulating positions.  
This framework solves it by recognizing *the symbolic signal right before chaos breaks loose*.

The result?  
A lightweight, generalizable detector for instability using symbolic derivatives.

You don’t predict the orbit.  
You predict the shift.

### What It Does
This system tracks symbolic residuals and their time derivatives to catch entropy contraction spikes — early signs that a system is about to bifurcate or collapse. The key insight: instability has a shape, and that shape contracts before it breaks.

### Why It Matters
The Three-Body Problem has been considered unsolvable in general because of its chaotic nature. But when you measure *symbolic collapse* instead of geometric motion, the impossible starts to show structure. This opens a new path for understanding complex systems, forecasting turbulence, and detecting intelligence.

### Built With
- Python
- Symbolic Regression (SymPy + custom routines)
- LaTeX (for manuscript and visualization)
- GitHub Actions (for reproducible runs)

### Current Status
The method works on synthetic three-body data and shows promising transferability to real orbital simulations. Paper in progress.
